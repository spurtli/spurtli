### Bug reports

Since Spurtli is still very new, we do expect some things to be a little buggy. If you come across something that doesn’t look right, please [feel free to create an issue](https://github.com/spurtli/spurtli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) or reach out to us by email.

### Create your own memento

You have an idea for a memento? That’s great! You know how to program and use [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)? That’s even better. Simply design your memento using mocked data, then open a pull request and we’ll make your memento become reality as soon as possible.

Don’t worry, if you don’t know how to program that’s fine. Just [open a feature request](https://github.com/spurtli/spurtli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) with your ideas and we’ll see what we can do to transform your idea into a memento.

## What’s next?

Hooray, we launched Spurtli! :tada:
However, since Spurtli is our side hustle and playground at the same time, we have lots of plans to make Spurtli even better.

These are the things that are next on our list of features:

- [ ] introduce payment API, so you’ll actually be able to buy your full resolution PDF prints and print them

- [ ] add activity selector for the memento creator, so you'll be able to select your activities separately and not only by date ranges
